# Overview

This is the base layer for charms that wish to take advantage of the
Apache Bigtop platform for configuring and deploying services via
puppet. [Including this layer][building] gives you access to a Python
class called Bigtop, which contains, among other things, tools for
triggering a puppet run.

# Usage

To create a charm using this base layer, first you must include it in
your `layer.yaml` file:

```yaml
includes: ['layer:apache-bigtop-base']
```

This will fetch the layer from [interfaces.juju.solutions][] and
incorporate it into your charm. To use the Bigtop class, import it,
then call its `.render_site_yaml` and `.trigger_puppet` routines in
sequence, like so (you might notice that Bigtop also has an `.install`
routine -- this is run automatically in the reactive handlers of this
layer; you don't need to call it yourself):

[interfaces.juju.solutions]: http://interfaces.juju.solutions/

```python
from charms.layer.apache_bigtop_base import Bigtop

# Setup arguments to pass to .render_site_yaml
hosts = {'some_bigtop_service': <host>}
roles = ['some_bigtop_service_nodetype0', 'some_bigtop_service_nodetype1']
override = {'some_bigtop_service::somekey': <somevalue>, ...}

# Trigger a puppet run
bigtop = Bigtop()
bigtop.render_site_yaml(hosts, roles, override)
bigtop.trigger_puppet()
```

This tells Bigtop to run puppet and install your service.

How does Bigtop know what to install? You tell it what to install by
passing a list of *roles* to `.render_site_yaml`. You may wish to
consult [this list of valid roles][roles] to see what is available.

[roles]: https://github.com/apache/bigtop/blob/master/bigtop-deploy/puppet/manifests/cluster.pp)

**Note**: Bigtop is also able to generate a list of roles from a
*component*. The Bigtop class is theoretically able to infer
components from the *hosts* dict that you pass to
`.render_site_yaml`. As of this writing, this code path is not well
tested, so you may want to specify roles explicitly. [List of
valid components][components].

## Reactive states

This layer will set the following states:

  * *bigtop.available*: This state is set after `Bigtop.install` has
      been run. At this point, you are free to invoke
      `Bigtop.render_site_yaml`.

## Layer configuration

Bigtop actually takes care of most of the configuration details for
you. You can specify overrides if needed -- either in code or in your
layer.yaml -- and pass those in in an *overrides* dict when you call
`Bigtop.render_site_yaml`.

Depending on your service, you'll also need to tell Bigtop where to
find important hosts, by passing a dict of *hosts* to
`Bigtop.render_site_yaml`.

The leadership layer may come in handy when it comes to populating
that hosts dict.

## Actions

This layer provides a generic `smoke-test` action that will invoke [Bigtop
smoke tests][bigtop-smoke]. This is meant to serve as a template for
writing a Bigtop charm-specific test. See the [Zookeeper smoke
test][zk-smoke] as an example of extending this generic action.

## Bigtop Source

Bigtop charms require project source that includes the puppet manifests and
modules used to deploy Bigtop software. This layer provides the ability to
specify a zip archive of the [Bigtop source repository][bigtop-repo]. By
default, the latest tagged release of the Bigtop source repository is used.
You may specify a different archive when deploying a Bigtop charm. For example:

```
juju deploy hadoop-namenode --resource bigtop-repo=/tmp/branch-1.1.zip
```

[bigtop-repo]: https://github.com/apache/bigtop/tree/master

## Unit Tests

To run unit tests for this layer, change to the root directory of the
layer in a terminal, and run `tox -c tox_unit.ini`. To tweak settings,
such as making the tests more or less verbose, edit tox_unit.ini.
