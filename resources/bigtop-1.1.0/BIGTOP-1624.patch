+############################# Server Basics #############################
+
+# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.
+broker.id=<%= @broker_id %>
+
+############################# Socket Server Settings #############################
+
+# The port the socket server listens on
+port=<%= @port %>
+
+# Hostname the broker will bind to. If not set, the server will bind to all interfaces
+#host.name=localhost
+
+# Hostname the broker will advertise to producers and consumers. If not set, it uses the
+# value for "host.name" if configured.  Otherwise, it will use the value returned from
+# java.net.InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName().
+#advertised.host.name=<hostname routable by clients>
+
+# The port to publish to ZooKeeper for clients to use. If this is not set,
+# it will publish the same port that the broker binds to.
+#advertised.port=<port accessible by clients>
+
+# The number of threads handling network requests
+num.network.threads=2
+ 
+# The number of threads doing disk I/O
+num.io.threads=8
+
+# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
+socket.send.buffer.bytes=1048576
+
+# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
+socket.receive.buffer.bytes=1048576
+
+# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
+socket.request.max.bytes=104857600
+
+
+############################# Log Basics #############################
+
+# A comma seperated list of directories under which to store log files
+log.dirs=/tmp/kafka-logs
+
+# The default number of log partitions per topic. More partitions allow greater
+# parallelism for consumption, but this will also result in more files across
+# the brokers.
+num.partitions=2
+
+############################# Log Flush Policy #############################
+
+# Messages are immediately written to the filesystem but by default we only fsync() to sync
+# the OS cache lazily. The following configurations control the flush of data to disk. 
+# There are a few important trade-offs here:
+#    1. Durability: Unflushed data may be lost if you are not using replication.
+#    2. Latency: Very large flush intervals may lead to latency spikes when the flush does occur as there will be a lot of data to flush.
+#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation, and a small flush interval may lead to exceessive seeks. 
+# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
+# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.
+
+# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
+#log.flush.interval.messages=10000
+
+# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
+#log.flush.interval.ms=1000
+
+############################# Log Retention Policy #############################
+
+# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
+# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
+# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
+# from the end of the log.
+
+# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion
+log.retention.hours=168
+
+# A size-based retention policy for logs. Segments are pruned from the log as long as the remaining
+# segments don't drop below log.retention.bytes.
+#log.retention.bytes=1073741824
+
+# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
+log.segment.bytes=536870912
+
+# The interval at which log segments are checked to see if they can be deleted according 
+# to the retention policies
+log.retention.check.interval.ms=60000
+
+# By default the log cleaner is disabled and the log retention policy will default to just delete segments after their retention expires.
+# If log.cleaner.enable=true is set the cleaner will be enabled and individual logs can then be marked for log compaction.
+log.cleaner.enable=false
+
+############################# Zookeeper #############################
+
+# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
+# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
+# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
+# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
+# root directory for all kafka znodes.
+zookeeper.connect=<%= @zookeeper_connection_string %>
+
+# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper
+zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=1000000
